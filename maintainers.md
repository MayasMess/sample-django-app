# Updating the Template Repository
This repo exists as a legible example of the app generated by the template repository. Due to `cookiecutter` formatting,
the source repository is difficult to read on its own. When bug-fixing or adding features, the following process will ensure
feature parity between repos and a smoother overall development cycle.

1. Create a new branch on this repo with your proposed changes
2. Create a new branch on the **template repo** with the changes from `django-sample-app`, adding any code needed for 
`cookiecutter` feature selection. This code is already present in many places throughout the template repo; 
look for `{%- if cookiecutter.feature_annotations == "on" -%}` for examples.
   1. If you are adding a new feature, make sure that you add the relevant feature tag to `hooks/post_gen_project.py` and
   that you have added a description of the feature to `readme.md`. 
   2. If you are updating an existing feature in a meaningful way (i.e. a breaking or significant change to its 
   usage paradigm) you should update the relevant part of `readme.md`.
   3. The dashes contained in the existing template tags are not mistakes; they are added intentionally to preserve 
   whitespace formatting during the `cookiecutter` project creation process. If you add a new feature, you should emulate
   the style of existing template tags.
3. Before creating a PR on the template repo, check out onto the `sample-django-app` repository and 
run the above command (substituting the name of your where there is "None" above) to update the app. 
Once you have ensured that it runs properly, make a PR on the template repo.
4. Return to the **django-sample-app** repo and make a pull request with your proposed changes.
